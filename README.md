 # E-Commerce Back End (ORM)
          
  ![Github license]()

  ## Description
  An e-commerce website needs to store all of their product information in a database which is my task for this assignment. This database will allow the product information to be created, received, updated, and deleted, which will all be done when the user interacts with the e-commerce store on the front-end when they are shopping for products and buying/ selling them.
